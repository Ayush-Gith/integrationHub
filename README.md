## Integrations Hub

Integrations Hub is a small Laravel backend for ingesting webhooks, managing third-party integrations, and syncing product data via background jobs. It's built to be easy to run locally and extend.

Key features
- JWT-based authentication (register, login, profile)
- Manage user Integrations with secure ownership checks
- CRUD operations for Products tied to Integrations
- Webhook ingestion endpoint (stores payloads and fires events)
- Queue-based background processing (Redis queues)

Tech stack
- PHP 7.4+ / Laravel 8
- Redis for queueing
- MySQL / MariaDB (or other supported DB)
- JWT Auth (tymon/jwt-auth)

Prerequisites
- PHP 7.4 or newer
- Composer
- Redis (for queues)
- A database (MySQL/Postgres)

Installation & setup
1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:

	cd integrations-hub
	composer install

2. Copy environment and configure DB/Redis credentials:

	cp .env.example .env
	# Edit .env to set DB_*, REDIS_*, and APP_URL

3. Generate app key and JWT secret:

	php artisan key:generate
	php artisan jwt:secret

4. Run migrations and seeders:

	php artisan migrate --seed

5. Start the app and a queue worker in separate terminals:

	php artisan serve
	php artisan queue:work --queue=products,default
